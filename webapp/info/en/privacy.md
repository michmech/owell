# Privacy statement

Opening the Well does not collect any personal information that falls under the UK’s [data protection legislation](https://www.gov.uk/data-protection), except the e-mail addresses of volunteer transcribers.

Apart from your e-mail address, Opening the Well also asks for your display name when you are registering as a volunteer transcriber. This does not have to be your real name – it can be a made-up nickname and you can change it anytime on the *Your profile* page.

## How we use your e-mail address

Your e-mail address serves as your user name when logging in, along with your password.

If you forget your password and request a password reset, Opening the Well will confirm it is you by sending a message to your e-mail address.

Opening the Well will never use your e-mail address for any other purpose than this, and will never give your e-mail address to an third party.

## Erasing your personal information from Opening the Well

If you want your e-mail address to be erased from Opening the Well’s records, you have to delete your voluteer transcriber account. There is an option for doing that on the *Your profile* page.

When you delete your account, your e-mail address will be removed from Opening the Well’s records permanently. This action cannot be undone. Any transcriptions you have made until that point will be credited to an “anynomous contributor”.
