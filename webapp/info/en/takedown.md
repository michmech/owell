# Takedown policy

For material presented here by ÈIST and the Opening the Well project, accessible on the Tobar an Dualchais platform, we have undertaken every effort and extensive work to correctly identify copyright holders and secure their permission to include items on the website. 

In some instances, recordings have been included where it has not been possible, despite our best efforts, to trace copyright holders or a next of kin. We have weighed the risk factors of presenting this material here and do so under risk-managed designation. 

If you have concerns around any material on our website that you wish to discuss further, please contact us at [eist@ed.ac.uk](mailto:eist@ed.ac.uk) or write to us at ÈIST Project Permissions, School of Scottish Studies Archives & Library, University of Edinburgh, 29 George Square, Edinburgh, EH8 9LD.

Please let us know the following when you contact us:

- Your name and contact details
- The TAD Track ID concerned. You are welcome to use the full URL of the page where the material is presented, as well as the original reference number if known.
- The reason for your request and evidence of your rights or authority (if applicable). For example, if you are the copyright holder, the closest member of their family or wish to put us in touch with the appropriate person.

We will consider all requests to take down material. On receipt, we aim to:

1. Respond and resolve your query within 30 working days (UoE *Heritage Collections* Service Standard).
2. Temporarily remove the material while we review the claim.
3. Consult with the University of Edinburgh and *Tobar an Dualchais/Kist o Riches*, and seek legal advice where needed.
4. Notify you of the outcome.

If you simply wish to correct or amend information related to contributors here, we will aim to update our website (if appropriate) within a similar time frame. 

We act in good faith to respect rights holders and communities while supporting Gaelic heritage.
