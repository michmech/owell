# Minimum technical requirements

Opening the Well was built with standard web technologies (HTML, CSS and JavaScript) and should work in any reasonably recent version of any modern web browser such as Mozilla Firefox, Google Chrome, Microsoft Edge and Apple Safari.

When working as a volunteer transcriber on Opening the Well, you will be interacting with a complex web interface which relies heavily in JavaScript and keyboard shortcuts. For this interface to work, your browser should not have JavaScript disabled and should not have keyboard shortcuts blocked. 

The transcription interface was designed with desktop and laptop computers in mind where a wide screen and a keyboard are available. It is not recommended to use this part of Opening the Well on narrow screens and on keyboardless devices such as mobile phones.
