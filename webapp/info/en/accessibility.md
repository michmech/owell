# Accessibility statement

Opening the Well is designed to be accessible for a wide range of users, including people with mobility and sensory impairments. Opening the Well complies with the World Wide Web Consortium’s [Web Content Accessibility Guidelines (WCAG) 2.2](https://www.w3.org/TR/WCAG22/) AA standard.

The only exception is the part of Opening the Well’s interface where volunteers transcribe recodings. Unavoidably, the transription task requires that users listen and read/write at the same time. For this reason, this part of Opening the Well may not be easily usable for people with hearing or visual impairments.
